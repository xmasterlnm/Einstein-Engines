WELCOME TO BASEDSTATION 14!

[color=#ff0000]Welcome to a totally new kind of server. Both anarchy and tyranny, but in potential - a potential determined by the players. [/color]

Here at Basedstation 14 we pride ourselves on our unique vision offering a dynamic gameplay experience which varies each round, due to hands-off administration. Will you create order and build a new society and livelihood amidst the stars, or will you contribute to the degeneracy and decay which plagues the stations of Nanotrasen? It is up to you. Declare independence, form a dictatorship, start a revolution, or preserve the order with creative policies, procedures, and rules within your department - it is up to YOU, the player, to make the experience an enjoyable and interesting one, and we give you the breathing room to make your adventure amidst the stars!
